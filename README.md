# Vehicles-detection
Object detection for vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Motorcycles, Buses) using YOLOv6 algorithm.

The code contains the following steps :

1. Setting up YOLOv6 Dependencies:
    - Mounting Google Drive
    - Cloning the Repository and Installing Requirements
    - Downloading weights 
    - Relevant Modules and functions 
    - Setting up arguments for inference
  
2. Running inference on single **image** ( The image used and the result is in : "Test data and results/Images/Test_img.jpg" ).
3. Runninig inference on **video** ( The video used and the result is in : "Test data and results/Videos/Test_vid.mp4" ).
4. Real-time detection using **webcam**.
